<h1>Hello Katharine</h1>
<p>
  My cause is to be happy. I have found that trying to be more than anything that makes me happy is meaningless. Everything I do is either because it makes me happy or will lead to something that makes me happy. Life is not all that complicated if you think about it like that.
